# Lab 06: Inheritance and Interfaces

In this Lab a Restaurant and Review classes had been made, each one has its own constructor.

The restaurant has 4 properties : name,stars, price category and reviews list, and it has a method to add a new review,
and I have overwritten the toString method.

The review class has 3 properties :author name,review body, and stars given. Also, the toString method is overwritten.

## Testing

For testing, I tested the constructor for each class, the toString, and the add review method in the restaurant class.
